	<h1> Helpful Facts about Copyright Law and the Web</h1>
	<br>
	<h2> Be Aware of Copyrighted Works</h2>
	<p> All material that has been registed in the United States will have the copyright symbol.
		The symbol &copy will affixed directly on the work itself.
		Before you copy or reproduce anything make sure the work is not protected by copyright.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Cite all Works</h2>
	<p> If you use any part of a copyrighted work in your research or project it is important
		that you cite where you got the information from. </p>
